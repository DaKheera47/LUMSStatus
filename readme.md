# LUMS Status

Are you tired of logging in and rechecking the LUMS Portal every 5 minutes in hopes of finding an acceptance, but only being disappointed seeing “Submitted”? Well, you’ll probably keep seeing the “Submitted” for a while more, but now you won’t have to check manually! This program has come to save the day. You can run it using your credentials, and it will check the portal and update a dashboard for you to check in one glance!

## Initial Download

1. Download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure you enable the `Add Python To Path` variable during installation
2. Download this program by clicking the latest release available
3. Extract the folder using 7zip or WinRAR

## Usage

1. Double click the `startLumsStatus.bat` file in the extracted folder
2. On the first start, the program will ask for your email and password, which is saved on your device for future login
3. Now, every 5 minutes the program will check the portal and update the black console screen with the refreshed information

## Advanced Features

- To change these variables, open the `main.py` file in any text editor and change the accordingly
    - `SHOW_BROWSER`: set this to `True` if you want to see the browser when the program checks the portal
    - `REFRESH_RATE`: how often the program should refresh (in mins) the information on the dashboard
- The code is fairly well commented, so if you want to have a look, you can!
